#BMI Calculator

--

I needed to learn Object Oriented Programming in C#, so I made this.

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhdzP_-UwJM) to get started, and I plan to do make this *properly*

Further plans

* Error handling (*an absolute must*)
* Style
* Imperial and metric support
